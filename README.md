# HomeMirror
Android application powering the mirror. This is adapted from

[Hannah Mitt's original post](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror)

Major changes:
====
* Display 20 top news headline auto-scrolling
* Include weather forecast in marquee

APIs provided by Yahoo Finance, Forecast.io, the BBC, and XKCD

How to Run (taken from Hannah's)
----
1. Clone project
2. Get a [forecast.io api key](https://developer.forecast.io/)
3. Add a keys.xml file under res/values with \<string name="dark_sky_api_key">your_key\</string>
4. Import project to Android Studio and run

When its mirror time, I also recommend turning on the device Developer Option: "Stay Awake - Screen will never sleep while charging"
